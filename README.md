# üß© TODO ‚Äì Auto-Advertisment Platform (Production Roadmap)

This document outlines all pending development and deployment tasks for the **Auto-Advertisment System** ‚Äî including backend automation, AI integrations, UI enhancements, and deployment infrastructure.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 1. Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

**Goal:** Automatically deploy changes to the production server when updates are pushed to the `main` branch.

### Tasks
- [ ‚úÖ ] Create a **GitHub repository** for the `Auto-Advertisment` backend (Node.js service).  
- [ ] Add a `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files (e.g., `serviceAccountKey.json`, `.env`, credentials, etc.).
- [ ] Configure **GitHub Actions** (or an alternative CI tool) with:
  - Trigger: `on push to main`
  - Steps:
    1. SSH into Hostinger VPS  
    2. `cd` into project directory  
    3. `git pull origin main` to fetch latest version  
    4. Run `docker compose build` to rebuild the Node service  
    5. Run `docker compose up -d` to restart containers and apply updates automatically
- [ ] Test by pushing a change to `main` and verifying that the server updates instantly.

## üñ•Ô∏è 2. Frontend UI for Product Uploads

**Goal:** Replace or enhance the current Excel-based upload with a modern web interface.

### Tasks
- [ ] Build a **frontend web app** (React / Next.js preferred) that allows business owners to:
  - Add product details (name, description, price, discount, etc.)
  - Upload a **product image** per product
  - Save product data directly to Firestore
- [ ] Integrate with **Firebase Storage**:
  - Store uploaded images  
  - Generate and save secure public URLs in Firestore
- [ ] Modify backend to:
  - Accept new product data via API (`/upload-products`)
  - Include image URLs in the Firestore entry
- [ ] Ensure validation for required fields and progress indicators for uploads.

## üß† 3. AI Prompt & Image Generation Enhancements

**Goal:** Make AI outputs more professional, context-aware, and aligned with the product type.

### Tasks
- [ ] Enhance the **OpenAI prompt** for `imagePrompt` generation:
  - Include terms like ‚Äúcommercial photography,‚Äù ‚Äústudio lighting,‚Äù and ‚Äúprofessional advertising composition.‚Äù
  - Dynamically adjust the scene based on product category (food, fashion, tools, etc.).
  - Use attached image reference (if available) in the AI prompt.
  - If no image exists ‚Üí instruct AI to **generate a realistic product image** from description alone.
  - Include the business‚Äôs branding or logo when relevant.
- [ ] Add optional business info fields (logo URL, brand colors, website, contact info) to the Firestore DB for future personalization.

---

## üé® 4. Image Generation Implementation

**Goal:** Integrate real image generation using **Google AI Studio (Gemini)** or another production-grade model.

### Tasks
- [ ] Connect backend to **Google AI Studio / Gemini API** for image generation.
- [ ] Send the `imagePrompt` generated by OpenAI to Gemini for final image output.
- [ ] Store generated images in **Firebase Storage** under each product.
- [ ] Test output quality, compare with prompt expectations, and fine-tune the prompt accordingly.

## üì± 5. ‚ÄúReady-to-Post‚Äù Social Media Preview

**Goal:** Automatically create professional post previews ready for publishing.

### Tasks
- [ ] Create a function that generates a **post mockup** combining:
  - AI-generated image  
  - Advertisement caption text  
  - Business branding (logo, name, website, contact info)
- [ ] Render a social-media style preview (Instagram / Facebook / TikTok post format)
- [ ] Store or serve this preview via API for review.

---

## ‚úâÔ∏è 6. Approval & Posting Automation

**Goal:** Allow business owners to approve or reject posts, and publish automatically if approved.

### Tasks
- [ ] Send a preview email to business owners containing:
  - The AI-generated post image
  - The advertisement caption
  - Buttons for ‚ÄúApprove‚Äù / ‚ÄúReject‚Äù
- [ ] If approved:
  - Upload directly to connected social platforms (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok)
  - Save confirmation and link in Firestore
- [ ] If rejected:
  - Flag the product for revision or new prompt generation.

---

## ‚è∞ 7. Scheduled Posting (Cron Job)

**Goal:** Automate daily post creation and publishing.

### Tasks
- [ ] Create a cron process or n8n schedule that calls the ‚Äúcreate post‚Äù endpoint once per day.
- [ ] Select the next eligible approved post from Firestore.
- [ ] Automatically trigger AI generation (if needed) and post publishing flow.
- [ ] Log all results (success/failure) to Firestore for tracking.
